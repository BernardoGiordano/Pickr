# Pickr3DS

After viewing one of the latest DONG's by Vsauce guys, I decided to port [Sean M. Tracey](https://twitter.com/seanmtracey) [**Pickr**](https://smt.codes/stuff/pickr/) game to the 3DS.

This completely is a **just for fun** project; I actually decided to challenge myself to complete it within a couple hours maximum.
